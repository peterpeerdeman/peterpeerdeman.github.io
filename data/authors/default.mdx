My name is [Peter Peerdeman](https://peterpeerdeman.nl), I am the technical director of the digital software studio [Lifely](https://lifely.nl) and I use the Hashbang blog as place for personal exploration, technical inspiration, thought vocalisation, knowledge distribution and just a bit of nerdy fun.

The blog started as a mainly technical writeup of challenges I faced when working on [#php](/tags/php), [#node](/tags/node), [#mobile](/tags/mobile) and [#devops](/tags/devops) projects. Slowly but steadily Hashbang turned into a place where I document all sorts of technical experiments and sideprojects, such as [#iot](/tags/iot), [#timeseries](/tags/timeseries) and [#machinelearning](/tags/machinelearning). The blog also functions as a log of all the [#presentations](/tags/presentations) I've given through my career on meetups and conferences.

If you don't know where to start, check out a couple of my favorite blogs here:
