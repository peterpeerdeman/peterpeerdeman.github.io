As I was deploying a fresh Ubuntu VM in my Proxmox environment, I found that it didn't have all the disk space available that I assigned when I created the VM. I used the following commands to ensure the image was able to use all of the available diskspace:

- Extend the logical volume `lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`
- Resize the filesystem `sudo resize2fs -p /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv`
- Check if the resize worked using `df -h`
