I stumbled upon this great little markdown visualizer tool created by [Joshua Wuyts](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts) called [VMD](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/vmd). For those using a lot of markdown in the commandline it can be extremely useful to quickly view a compiled version of your markdown file in pretty github style formatting.

Because the tool is written in nodejs and electron you can install it globally using

```
npm install -g vmd
```

and use it on any markdown file using

```
vmd README.md
```

VMD then instantly shows a window with a rendered version of your markdown file. It even watches the original file for changes and instantly updates the rendered version if you save the file!
