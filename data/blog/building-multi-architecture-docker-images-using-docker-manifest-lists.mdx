In the aftermath of [adding an i386 node](./why-i-am-adding-virtualisation-with-proxmox-to-my-infrastructure) to my [kubernetes cluster](./kubernetes-cluster-build-with-raspberry-pi-and-poe-hats), it was about time to dig into the creation of multi-architecture docker images. When you visit docker hub and look at a popular image, you often see a list of difference images, each with a different OS/ARCH label:

![](../assets/images/2024-07-04-multiarch.png)

This is achieved using docker manifest lists. A manifest lst has a tag, similar to a docker tag but actually refers to a list of images, possibly with different architectures. If we build our project multiple times, and specifying a specific platform during each build, we can then create a `manifest` that references the images for different platforms.

I'll show both the manual way of creating such a manifest through the command line, and provide a github action workflow you can use to automatically build a (public) project to multiple images and upload them to an artifact repository.

## Manual multi architecture manifest

As I previously discussed in [the buildx blog](./building-raspberry-pi-arm64-images-on-desktop-using-docker-buildx), we can use buildx to emulate a build on a different platform. In this example, we first build for `amd64`, and then build for `linux/arm64`.

```
docker buildx build -t peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-amd64 --platform linux/amd64 --push -f Dockerfile .

docker buildx build -t peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-arm64 --platform linux/arm64 --push -f Dockerfile .
```

after creating and pushing the images, we can now create a manifest file, and "amend" that manifest with the two images we have just created. 

```
docker manifest create peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0 --amend peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-arm64 --amend peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-amd64
```

We can then push the manifest file and enjoy the convenience of our future docker pulls automatically pulling the right image for the architecture that you are working on.

```
docker manifest push peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0
```

The next step is to automate this process completely. We can go about this is by creating a github action that automatically triggers the building of images when a change is pushed to the repository. I've used the following workflow file `main.yaml` in the `.github/workflows/` folder of a repository to automatically build both the `amd64` and `arm64` images:

```
name: ci

on:
  push:

jobs:
  docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set up QEMU
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v3
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
        with:
          platforms: linux/arm64, linux/amd64
          push: true
          tags: peterpeerdeman/darts-timeseries-forecaster:latest, peterpeerdeman/darts-timeseries-forecaster:${{ github.sha }}
````

The only thing left is configuring the secrets in your github repository. So create an access token for you docker hub account on `https://app.docker.com/settings/personal-access-tokens` and use them as "repository secrets" in your github repo's settings / security / secrets and variables / actions.
