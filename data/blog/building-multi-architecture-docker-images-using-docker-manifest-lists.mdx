In the aftermath of [adding an i386 node](./why-i-am-adding-virtualisation-with-proxmox-to-my-infrastructure) to my [kubernetes cluster](./kubernetes-cluster-build-with-raspberry-pi-and-poe-hats), it was about time to dig into the creation of multi-architecture docker images. When you visit docker hub and look at a popular image, you often see a list of difference images, each with a different OS/ARCH label:

This is achieved using docker manifest lists. A manifest lst has a tag, similar to a docker tag but actually refers to a list of images, possibly with different architectures. If we build our project multiple times, and specifying a specific platform during each build, we can then create a `manifest` that references the images for different platforms.

I'll show both the manual way of creating such a manifest through the command line, and provide a github action workflow you can use to automatically build a (public) project to multiple images and upload them to an artifact repository.

## Manual multi architecture manifest

As I previously discussed in [the buildx blog](./building-raspberry-pi-arm64-images-on-desktop-using-docker-buildx), we can use buildx to emulate a build on a different platform. In this example, we first build for `amd64`, and then build for `linux/arm64`.

```
docker buildx build -t peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-amd64 --platform linux/amd64 --push -f Dockerfile .

docker buildx build -t peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-arm64 --platform linux/arm64 --push -f Dockerfile .
```

after creating and pushing the images, we can now create a manifest file, and "amend" that manifest with the two images we have just created. 

```
docker manifest create peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0 --amend peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-arm64 --amend peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0-amd64
```

We can then push the manifest file and enjoy the convenience of our future docker pulls automatically pulling the right image for the architecture that you are working on!

```
docker manifest push peterpeerdeman/lightning-logger:1.1.0
```
