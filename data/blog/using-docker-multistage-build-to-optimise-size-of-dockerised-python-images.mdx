As I was working on [my next python timeseries forecasting project using Darts](https://github.com/peterpeerdeman/darts-timeseries-forecaster), I found out darts doesn't quite like builing it's dependencies on the python slim image I was using in my Dockerfile.

When using the non-slim image, the build would succeed, but build into a big 1,5G image file, which isn't optimal. I remembered using a multistage build in my nodejs projects and found out in [this example on github](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/python-multistage-docker) that this is also possible in python.

For completeness, this is the dockerfile I ended up using:

```
FROM python:3.9.19 as base

RUN mkdir /app
COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . /app

CMD python app.py

FROM python:3.9.19-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=base /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/

COPY --from=base /app /app

CMD python app.py
```
