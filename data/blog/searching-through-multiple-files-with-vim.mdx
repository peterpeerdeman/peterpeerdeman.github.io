Just as a reminder to myself and to everyone looking for a short and easy answer to get a quick vim project search going:

-   `brew install the_silver_searcher` (this is an amazingly fast file searcher)
-   download and configure the [vim ack plugin](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim)
-   enter the following code in vimrc file to enable ag as default for ack

```vim
if executable('ag')
let g:ackprg = 'ag --vimgrep'
endif
```

-   `:Ack TIMESTAMP` to find the word TIMESTAMP in any file in the current directory
-   `:cn` for next and `:cp` for previous hit
-   install [vim-unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) for access to shortkeys `[q` and `]q` for jumping through hits

### fallback

Ofcourse, you could also use vimgrep which will work without installing any plugins but is a lot slower:

`:vimgrep <searchterm> **/*.<fileextension>`

-   e.g. `:vimgrep TIMESTAMP *.*` to find the word TIMESTAMP in any file in the current directory
-   e.g. `:vimgrep /\v\d{5}/g **/*.md` to recursively find all 5 number strings in any markdown file in the current project
