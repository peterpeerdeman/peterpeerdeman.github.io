What if you have never built a webapplication before? Where would you start? In this guest lecture for firstyear computer science students I explain the different stages of software development and show some examples what we do during these stages:

-   Concept
-   Interaction design
-   Architecture
-   Development (SCRUM)
-   Deployment
-   Analytics & Monitoring

In the second part, I do a small technical deepdive on serverside rendering vs clientside rendering and show how applications can even stream data in realtime through a websocket.

The slides can be found on [github](http://peterpeerdeman.github.io/webapplications-from-concept-to-code/)

This guest lecture was given on the 28th of September 2015 at [AvansHogeschool](http://www.avans.nl/)
