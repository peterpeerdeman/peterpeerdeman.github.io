[Slidev](https://sli.dev/) is a very nice presenter framework that turns markdown files into presentations with a single command. It ties perfectly into my markdown based obsidian note taking setup and includes some nice clean formatting templates to quickly produce slide decks with all the typical features you'd need to give a quick presentation.

As slidev said:
> When working with WYSIWYG editors, it is easy to get distracted by the styling options. Slidev remedies that by separating the content and visuals. This allows you to focus on one thing at a time, while also being able to reuse the themes from the community.

It is clear that slidev is built to give presentations on technical, code related topics. The excellent code highlighting and click animations for highlighting specific lines is great. For typical keynote style presentations the layout is a bit limited. Luckily you can create local css and css that is shared across slides, I've definitely resorted to manual html formatting and use of css in multiple occassions.

There is always a tradeoff between beeing able to completely control each slide layout and be able to leverage the default template quickly. As in the olden days of university (using latex to generated pdf slides), I think adding a couple of dividers in your markdown file and building the results into a presentable, shareable html result is a very nice way to share your markdown thoughts visually.
