Just a little tidbit on hardening. As I was [setting up some services with Traefik's IngressRoutes](./manage-ssl-certificates-and-ingress-for-services-in-k3s-kubernetes-cluster-using-cert-manager-letsencrypt-and-traefik) I wanted to see what I could do to easily harden these services. 

There are very elaborate solutions to doing extensive hardening on kubernetes services such as [crowdseq](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec) wich is similar to solutions such as fail2ban we had back in the apache2 days. But if you really quickly just want to put some ratelimiting up on a service, you can far more easily accomplish this with Traefik Middlewares.

To for instance ratelimit an IngressRoute, we add a special type `Middleware` entity, describe it's spec variables and add it to the existing ingressroute directly under the route configuration. Apply the file and the rate-limited endpoint is good to go!

```
apiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  name: service-ratelimit
  namespace: service
spec:
  rateLimit:
    average: 100
    burst: 200
---
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: IngressRoute
metadata:
  name: service-ingress-route
  namespace: service
spec:
  entryPoints:
    - websecure
  routes:
    - match: Host(`subdomain.url.com`)
      kind: Rule
      services:
        - name: servicename-service
          port: 5554
      middlewares:
        - name: service-ratelimit
  tls:
    secretName: subdomain-url-com-production
```

In addition to ratelimiting, you could quickly protect your endpoints with for instance the original `IPWhitelist` or `BasicAuth` middlewares, and I suspect they have reserved the more powerful middlewares for the Traefik enterprise API gateway solution.
