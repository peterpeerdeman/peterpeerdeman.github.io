If you silently overwrite a docker image in your registry with a new version, the image might not get automatically updated if you specified that version in your kubernetes configuration. In that case, add the following `imagePullPolicy` to ensure the image is always refetched, even if it is the same version number.

More details on the working of the image pull policy can be found in [this stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33112789/how-do-i-force-kubernetes-to-re-pull-an-image)

```
imagePullPolicy: Always
```
