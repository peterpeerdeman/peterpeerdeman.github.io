One of the things I missed after [abandoning Readwise for Wallabag](./replacing-readwise-with-self-hosted-open-source-wallabag-with-obsidian-wallabag-plugin) was the serendipitous resurfacing of old highlights, that would often trigger new thoughts. To include some extra serendipity into my daily notemaking, I made a slight modification to [the snippet provided by dhniceday](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-add-links-to-random-notes-to-daily-note/52379/2) to show use the [dataview plugin](https://obsidian.rocks/dataview-in-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/) to show a couple of random notes from your vault everytime you open your daily note:

```
## Random notes
```dataviewjs
app.vault.getFiles() 
const files = app.vault.getFiles() 
for (i=0; i<3;i++) {
	const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * (files.length - 1)) 
	const randomNote = files[random] 
	dv.paragraph('[[' + randomNote.basename + ']]') 
}
```

There are some great other ideas on serendipity in at the [obsidian serendipity blog](https://obsidian.rocks/embrace-serendipity-discovering-old-notes-in-obsidian/)
