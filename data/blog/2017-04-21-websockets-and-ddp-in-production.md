In this guestlecture I show an example of a realtime application we built using Meteor and DDP. Along the way I explain how the DDP realtime protocol works, what the data through websockets looks like and how to consume this API data with the `ddp-client` npm package.

The slides and materials can be found on [github](http://peterpeerdeman.github.io/websockets-and-ddp-in-production)

This talk was given on 21-04-2017 as a guest lecture at the [HvA CMD - Everything Web Minor](https://moodle.cmd.hva.nl/course/index.php?categoryid=26) for the course "Real-Time Web"
