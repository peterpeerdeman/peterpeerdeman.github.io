On the 4th of December 2013 I gave a talk at the JSMVC meetup about consuming RESTful resources with AngularJS. We use the Restangular module for AngularJS which greatly simplifies interacting with a RESTful backend in an AngularJS application.

The slides can be found on [http://hashbang.nl/consuming-restful-resources-with-angularjs/#/](http://hashbang.nl/consuming-restful-resources-with-angularjs/#/).
