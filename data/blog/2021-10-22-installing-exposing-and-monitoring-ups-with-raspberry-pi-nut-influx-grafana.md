To protect my Raspberry Pi server against sudden power outage and power fluctuations I've decided to install an "Uninterruptable Power Supply", or "UPS". I got the [APC Back-UPS 2200VA, 230V, AVR, 4 Schuko outlets](https://www.apc.com/shop/ug/en/products/APC-Back-UPS-2200VA-230V-AVR-4-Schuko-outlets/P-BX2200MI-GR) that gives my raspberry pi a window of about 1 hour to properly shut down without damaging the hardware or losing data.

## Serving the UPS API

It looks like UPS systems have been around for quite a while, and not a whole lot has happened in that space as the software to monitor these devices is quite arcane. I finally settled on [nutupsd](https://networkupstools.org/) to expose the UPS statistics, using the following docker-compose config:

```yml
version: '3.3'
services:
    nutupsd:
        container_name: nutupsd
        image: instantlinux/nut-upsd:2.7.4-r8
        restart: always
        environment:
            SERIAL: ${UPS_1_SERIAL}
        ports:
            - '3493:3493/tcp'
        secrets:
            - nut-upsd-password
        privileged: true
```

## Trying out the UPS API

We now have a server application running on port 3493 that exposes the UPS statistics detected through the USB cable coming from the UPS. Back in the day, there was no REST, no JSON and not even XML or SOAP. You can test the API only with [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat), connecting to the port directly and sending ASCII commands such as `LIST UPS` and `LIST VAR <upsname>` to retrieve the data:

```bash
Â» nc 127.0.0.1 3493
LIST UPS

BEGIN LIST UPS
UPS ups "UPS"
END LIST UPS

LIST VAR ups

BEGIN LIST VAR ups
VAR ups battery.charge "100"
VAR ups battery.charge.low "1"
VAR ups battery.mfr.date "2001/01/01"
VAR ups battery.runtime "3816"
VAR ups battery.runtime.low "120"
VAR ups battery.type "PbAc"
VAR ups battery.voltage "27.2"
VAR ups battery.voltage.nominal "24.0"
VAR ups device.mfr "American Power Conversion"
VAR ups device.model "Back-UPS BX2200MI"
...
VAR ups ups.status "OL"
...
```

## Exporting the UPS data to influxdb

To get a more visual look at the UPS status I've used [nut-influxdb-exporter](https://github.com/kiwimato/nut-influxdb-exporter) to export these details to influxdb, using the following docker-compose config:

```yml
version: '3.3'
services:
    nutlogger:
        container_name: nutlogger
        image: peterpeerdeman/nut-influxdb-exporter:1.0.0
        restart: always
        environment:
            INFLUXDB_DATABASE: nutups
            INFLUXDB_HOST: influxdb
            NUT_HOST: nutupsd
            NUT_PORT: 3493
        depends_on:
            - influxdb
    influxdb:
        ports:
            - '8086:8086'
        volumes:
            - ~/influxdb/data:/var/lib/influxdb/data
            - ~/influxdb/meta:/var/lib/influxdb/meta
            - ~/influxdb/wal:/var/lib/influxdb/wal
            - ~/influxdb/config:/var/etc/influxdb
        restart: always
        container_name: influxdb
        image: influxdb:1.8.10
    grafana:
        ports:
            - '3001:3000'
        volumes:
            - ~/grafana/data:/var/lib/grafana
        environment:
        restart: always
        container_name: grafana
        image: grafana/grafana:8.4.5
        depends_on:
            - influxdb
```

## Visualising a power outage

Nutlogger now extracts the information from `nutupsd` every 10 seconds and feeds this as a datapoint to influxdb. We can now visualise the timeseries in grafana by plotting the data over time. Below is an image of the system in action, where the power went out for a short duration. You can see the input voltage dropping to 0, the UPS charge declining sharply, the status history turning to "discharging" (in blue). When the power went back on, the status turned to "online, charging" and the UPS charge slowly rising again.

My grafana dashboard is derived from the dashboard export by kiwimato, [you can find that in the nut-influxdb-exporter repository here](https://github.com/kiwimato/nut-influxdb-exporter/blob/main/Unraid%20System%20Dashboard%20New-1577093376607.json).

## Alerting and shutting down

To keep up to date with the current status I set up some grafana alerts to send emails when power goes out, and when the battery is low. This allows me to do a manual shutdown or wait out the power outage. In addition to the visual monitoring, I've setup `upsmon` on some of the servers that I want to automatically shut down when the UPS battery levels are low.

I've installed these services with `apt-get`, by following [this guide by Mike R](https://perfecto25.medium.com/monitor-cyberpower-ups-devices-with-raspberry-pi-99559725dbb8). The only difference is when setting the `MONITOR` line using the IP-address of the server that is running the nutupsd daemon instead of the localhost.

## Testing

Wrapping up, it is of course wise to test the system for proper working. I ran `sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog` on the server that is monitoring the UPS, briefly pulled the plug on the UPS and could see that it immediately recognized the outage:

```
Apr 20 18:23:17 raspberrypi systemd[1]: Started Network UPS Tools - power device monitor and shutdown controller.
Apr 20 18:31:57 raspberrypi upsmon[10060]: UPS UPS@192.168.x.x on battery

Broadcast message from nut@raspberrypi (somewhere) (Wed Apr 20 18:31:57 2022):

UPS UPS@192.168.x.x on battery

Apr 20 18:33:02 raspberrypi upsmon[10060]: UPS UPS@192.168.x.x on line power

Broadcast message from nut@raspberrypi (somewhere) (Wed Apr 20 18:33:02 2022):

UPS UPS@192.168.x.x on line power
```

To do a full shutdown test, You could of course pull the plug on the UPS, let the battery die down and see if the nut clients that are connected will actually shut down by then, but it is also possible to simulate a critical power level and send an immediate shutdown to all devices listening to the upsmon. To do this, I went into the nutupsd docker container and ran the `upsmon` shutdown command there:

```bash
$ docker exec -it nutupsd /bin/sh
/ # upsmon -c fsd
```

On the server that was monitoring the UPS, we now see a message that a forced shutdown is in progress, and after a couple of seconds starts shutting down the system gracefully, as expected!

```
