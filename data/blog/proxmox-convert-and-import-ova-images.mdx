you can log in to the proxmox shell, check if you could access the share, create a directory and mount the NFS disk by hand, which is also very convenient when you want to import large machine image files from a separate machine:

```
showmount -e 192.168.0.5
mkdir /mnt/nfsshare
mount 192.168.0.5:/home/peter/nfsshare /mnt/nfsshare/
```
