A step by step reference of the dependency upgrading process in flutter mobile applications, which seemingly changes about every time I blink my eyes:

## Upgrade Flutter and Android SDK versions

- First `flutter upgrade`
- Then upgrade dependencies
  - `flutter pub outdated`
  - `flutter pub upgrade`
  - `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` (only if needed)
- `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSDKVersion` should be upgraded automatically since flutter 3.5

## Test the release

- connect android device with usb-c cable
- `flutter run`

## building release

- Adjust `flutter.versionCode` in `local.properties` file
- Bump the `version` in `pubspec.yaml` (at least increase the value behind the plus sign)
- Ensure keystore is present (in my case, container with keystore is mounted)
- Run `flutter build appbundle`

## uploading release

- Upload the resulting app bundle to app bundle selector via [developer console](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers)
- Go to release/production [developer console page](https://play.google.com/console/u/0/developers/7743440429079041357/app/4976044628703597282/tracks/production)
- Press create release button top right, follow wizard
- Go to publishing overview, send new release "send for review"
