Either you've read about cleaning up git commits a million times, or not at all. I heard about it but never really gave it a shot before but after "the git-father" [@chielkunkels](http://www.twitter.com/chielkunkels) showed me how easy it is to rewrite your history, everyone should at least give `git commit --amend` and `git rebase -i` a try.

The specifics of these commands have been explained pretty well in the following blogposts, so I'll happily refer to them if you want to join the club of clean committers!

-   ["Git Interactive Rebase, Squash, Amend and Other Ways of Rewriting History" by Thoughtbot](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/git-interactive-rebase-squash-amend-rewriting-history) - a very nice overview of the concepts I'm talking about
-   ["squashing commits with rebase" by gitready](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) - a very concrete example of why you'd want to squash a commit.
