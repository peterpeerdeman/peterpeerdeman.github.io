You have probably integrated a fair share of REST APIs in your frontend applications. Ever wished you could decide for yourself what combination of data and fields the backend should return? GraphQL is an API language that allows backend teams to expose strongly typed, automatically documented APIs that are a joy for the frontend team to work with. Peter would love to give you an insight on what GraphQL is and how his team at Lifely uses GraphQL with NodeJS, React and Apollo.

This video was recorded by Saxum at the [Saxum Food 'n Code meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Food-n-Code/events/256265403/), 13-12-2018.
