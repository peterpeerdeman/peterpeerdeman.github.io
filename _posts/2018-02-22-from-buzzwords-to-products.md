The technology industry is overflowing with buzzwords. Iâ€™ll look into a set of these words and explain how we translate them into tangible solutions for our customers. Along the way I'll explain what our development process looks like and show you how we use tech like react, reactnative, nodejs, docker and graphql in our versatile teams to deliver custom built software to our customers in all kinds of industries.

This talk was given on 22-02-2018 as a conference talk at the [Tech020 2018](https://tech020.org/)
