On the 16th of October 2014 I gave a presentation about using RabbitMQ in Symfony2 applications at the [Symfony2 meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Symfony-User-Group-NL/events/209648562/) in Amsterdam. 

The slides can be found at "[Queueing jobs with RabbitMQ and Symfony2](http://hashbang.nl/queueing-jobs-with-rabbitmq-and-symfony2/)"
