We have all seen the hybrid platforms before. The promise is great but it never really worked that well in practice, until React Native came along. React Native is the hybrid platform that made our javascript development agency love to build apps again and I would love to share all the benefits we enjoy from having just one codebase and QA process.

This talk was given at Appril conference festival in Amsterdam on April 11th 2018
