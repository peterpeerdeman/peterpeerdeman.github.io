In the Hello Mentor project I was one of the mentors giving a mentorship to one of the students of the programme. During the project I gave a presentation to the whole team about expert tracks vs management tracks. Included at the end of the slides is a bunch of tips on how to build a good portfolio as a start in the tech scene.

The slides for this presentation can be found at [this url](https://files.lifely.nl/hello-mentor-expert-tracks-vs-management-tracks-and-portfolio.pdf)
